# Deepfake-Image-Detection

This project focuses on detecting deepfake images using deep learning models.  
The notebook (`Copy_of_ANNA(deepfake_image_detection)project.ipynb`) trains and evaluates models on the **RVF10K (Real vs Fake Faces - 10k)** dataset from Kaggle.




## 📊 Dataset
- **Dataset Used:** [RVF10K – Real vs Fake Faces (10k)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- **Description:** Contains 10,000 labeled images (`real` vs `fake`).
- **Format:** Images in `.jpg` format with labels.

> ⚠️ Note: Due to Kaggle’s terms, the dataset is not included in this repo.  
You need to download it manually from Kaggle and place it in your working directory.
